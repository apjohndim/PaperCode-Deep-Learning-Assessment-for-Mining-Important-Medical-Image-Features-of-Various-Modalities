Abstract
Deep learning (DL) is a well-established pipeline for feature extraction in medical and nonmedical imaging tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. However, DL faces the issue of explainability, which prohibits reliable utilisation in everyday clinical practice. This study evaluates DL methods for their efficiency in revealing and suggesting potential image biomarkers. Eleven biomedical image datasets of various modalities are utilised, including SPECT, CT, photographs, microscopy, and X-ray. Seven state-of-the-art CNNs are employed and tuned to perform image classification in tasks. The main conclusion of the research is that DL reveals potential biomarkers in several cases, especially when the models are trained from scratch in domains where low-level features such as shapes and edges are not enough to make decisions. Furthermore, in some cases, device acquisition variations slightly affect the performance of DL models.
